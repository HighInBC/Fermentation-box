# Fermentation-box

THIS PROJECT IS NOT READY FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION. It is buggy.

A control system to keep a fermentation chamber at a constant target temperature

This will run off of an ESP8266 module and will control a relay for heat and a relay for cooling providing an ideal fermenting environment.
